A TiddlyWeb plugin that provides a mechanism to dispatch to one of 
several wikitext rendering systems based on defined key in the WSGI
environment.

To use update tiddlywebconfig.py to include:

    wikitext.default_renderer': 'tiddlywebplugins.multirender',
    'wikitext.default_render_map': {
        'text/x-tiddlywiki': 'tiddlywebplugins.multirender',
    },

By default the 'raw' rendering subsystem will be used, but if
'tiddlyweb.wikirender' is set in environ, then the value of that 
will be used as a renderer.

The genesis of this plugin was needing to test multiple rendering
systems, driven by user choices, on TiddlySpace.
